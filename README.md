# Tarkov-Map-Overlay

A simple application to show you a map while playing Tarkov. Check the [Releases](https://github.com/UberSwe/Tarkov-Map-Overlay/releases) page for the latest .exe file.

# Basics

Run the .exe file, it will show a window which is always on top. Use the menu to select a map, browse for a png/jpg file and change the window opacity. Use the "M" key on your keyboard to minimize and show the window when needed.

# Known issues and future plans

 - The window listens to click events when you look in your inventory or stash. This can be fixed later but it was too much work for the initial release.
 - Save the state so that the application remembers the last map you looked at and it's position and size.
 - Fix the menu so that it's always visible and remove the white background areas, make them transparent.
 
 I didn't make any of the maps, I included some maps from [the official Tarkov wiki(https://escapefromtarkov.gamepedia.com/Escape_from_Tarkov_Wiki) for convenience and I do not claim any rights to them nor do they fall under the License of this project.
