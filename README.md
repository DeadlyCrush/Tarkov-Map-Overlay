A simple application to show you a map while playing Tarkov. Check the [Releases](https://github.com/UberSwe/Tarkov-Map-Overlay/releases) page for the latest .exe file. Download the .exe under assets below and the click on it to run it. No installation needed. You may need to click "more info" and allow the application to run.

# Install

Download and run the .exe file, there is no installation needed. it will show a window which is always on top. Use the menu to select a map, browse for a png/jpg file and change the window opacity. Use the "M" key on your keyboard to minimize and show the window when needed.

## Am I allowed to use this? Will I get banned?

There is no reason to worry. This application is independent from the Escape From Tarkov files. I was very careful not to interact with tha game itself. This application is just a very simple windows app which shows images and stays on top of things.

# Known issues and future plans

 - The window listens to click events when you look in your inventory or stash. This can be fixed later but it was too much work for the initial release.
 - Save the state so that the application remembers the last map you looked at and it's position and size.
 
 I didn't make any of the maps, I included some maps from [the official Tarkov wiki](https://escapefromtarkov.gamepedia.com/Escape_from_Tarkov_Wiki) for convenience and I do not claim any rights to them nor do they fall under the License of this project.
